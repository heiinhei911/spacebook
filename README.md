## Instructions

Once the app has been loaded up, you will a banner and five posts about all things related to the space and NASA.

Inside each post, you will see \(from top to bottom\) the following information:

- the author's icon
- the author's name
- the date of when the post is published
- the location of the post is taking place/took place
- the image of the post
- the "thumbs up" or the "like" button
- the caption of the post

If you see a that you particularly like, you can "like" the post by clicking the "thumbs up" or "Like" button in between the post image and its caption.

If you want to see new posts, you can click the "click to view new posts!" button at the bottom to pull in new posts.

Finally, there is a light switch at the top right corner of the screen so you can switch between light and dark mode according to your preference at anytime.

Have fun browsing!

## Note

Your posts and likes will be automatically saved to the browser so you have come back at anytime and pick up on where you have left off. Old posts will be retained in the browser's storage and displayed in the app unless new posts have been requested.
